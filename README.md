## Using Frontline with the Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox

I setup my Frontline system to use the Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox.

Results of my testing:
+ In the Frontline app, I cannot send a first message because my account doesnâ€™t have any templates, and Frontline app does not pickup the Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox templates for me to use.
+ I can use a program(I use curl) to send template messages to my WhatsApp user.
+ In my WhatsApp user app, I can receive and read messages from my program.
+ In my WhatsApp user app, I can send messages to my Frontline user.
+ In my Frontline app, I can receive and read messages from my WhatsApp user.
+ In my Frontline app, I can reply to the received messages from my WhatsApp user.
+ In my WhatsApp user app, I can receive and read messages from my Frontline user.

Sending WhatsApp messages to a WhatsApp user, from the Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox sender id.
````
curl -X POST https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/$MASTER_ACCOUNT_SID/Messages.json \
--data-urlencode 'To=whatsapp:+16505552222' \
--data-urlencode 'From=whatsapp:+14155238886' \
--data-urlencode 'Body=Your Twilio code is 1234561' \
-u $MASTER_ACCOUNT_SID:$MASTER_AUTH_TOKEN
